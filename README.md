## Libraries Used

### 1. **Pandas**
   - **Description**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing data structures like DataFrames to work with structured data.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

### 2. **NumPy**
   - **Description**: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install numpy
     ```

### 3. **Matplotlib**
   - **Description**: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

### 4. **Seaborn**
   - **Description**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install seaborn
     ```

### 5. **SciPy**
   - **Description**: A library used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level functions that operate on NumPy arrays.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install scipy
     ```

### 6. **FuzzyWuzzy**
   - **Description**: A library for string matching that uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences. It helps in fuzzy string matching.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install fuzzywuzzy
     ```

### 7. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
   - **Description**: A platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install nltk
     ```
   - **Note**: After installing, you may need to download additional datasets:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('punkt')
     nltk.download('stopwords')
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     ```

### 8. **Scikit-learn**
   - **Description**: A machine learning library for Python that features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support for model selection and evaluation.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```

### 9. **Requests**
   - **Description**: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python, used for making HTTP requests to APIs and handling responses.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```
